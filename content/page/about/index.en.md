I have been thinking for a long time, but I still don't know how to write the "About Me" section.

I have also read many bloggers' posts and found that they are all very good. They write very clearly about what they have experienced and what awards they have won.

But when I think about myself, it seems that I don't have anything to show off.

I have an ordinary education, an ordinary family background, and even my achievements are ordinary (~~ not even as good as ordinary people~~)

When I was a child, I thought for a while that everyone in this world was an NPC except me.

But when I grew up, I found that I was the NPC.

I have accomplished nothing and always waited for something inexplicably. This may be the best description of my recent life.

The **Battle of the Twin Cities** series of cartoons is my favorite, even though I don't play League of Legends.

I liked to play **table tennis** when I was a child, but I no longer play it for various reasons.

I like to read **online novels**, and have read many pirated free novels, and have also followed the genuine paid novels, but recently I have been "digging for gold in the shit" on Tomato Free Novels.

I am originally from the computer science department, but looking back, I have done a lot of other non-computer things.

I used to run a **WeChat public account** and tried to post articles, but the number of readers was very small (there were not as many public accounts as there are in 2024), and I was not active for three days and did not post for two days, so the public account was shelved.

I also tried **novel push**, but after persisting for a month, I only earned a few dozen yuan, so I gave up. It was too tiring every day, and I had to rely on the platform's push mechanism to make a living.

I tried **writing novels**, but persistence is the key to this thing. I can't type many words every day, which is different from what I expected before I started writing.

I posted game videos on a certain platform (I wanted to be a **game blogger** at first), but I found that the video, video is not good, and the live broadcast, live broadcast is not good. Those bloggers with hundreds of thousands of fans should have a team, unlike me, who manages all aspects such as editing, private messages, game content, etc. by myself, which is very tiring.

Looking back, I found that I had no achievements or contributions in technology.

I have never written a famous open source project, but I have starred many open source projects.

Because I despised the training class, I didn't even follow the popular takeaway.

When I was in college, because I was **introverted** and **knew nothing**, I participated in the school's robotics laboratory, but I didn't study in this direction in depth.

Now think about it, if I didn't want to build a web site in my heart, and persisted, the future might not be like this.

A few years ago, NFT was rampant, and I was unfortunately involved in it. There were also many money-making platforms in China. In this process, I also learned to write software in Easy Language, but unfortunately I didn't make any money, but I lost a lot.

My career was miserable, and similarly, I was at a loss in love.

I liked a girl very much in high school, and I liked her so much that my friends could notice my secret crush. But the other party had no idea about me, and naturally it ended in nothing.

I once made a promise with another girl: to be good friends for life.

But as time goes by and we are separated in college, we are no longer in touch.

I don’t even know how long it will take for the people who shared the same dormitory in college to become strangers, after all, we are from different places.

In one’s life, friends seem to leave over time.

Take my good friends in elementary school, junior high school, and high school, for example, we are no longer in touch now.

People will eventually return to a state of loneliness.

This may be the reason why I want to write this blog.

Because I am afraid of loneliness, I write a blog to attract people who can empathize with me and exchange comments together.

I have said a lot, so let’s stop here, just like life, it has not yet come to an end.

Everything in the future is still unknown
