## Introduction

Every time I see a big guy's Github homepage is very cool, I always envy him. Those big guys are really amazing. Not only are they technically strong, but even their Github personal homepages are cool.  
So I looked up information and finally decided to beautify my Github homepage  
~~(although I am a rookie and have not written any good open source projects...)~~

## Beautify your personal homepage

> GitHub supports custom homepages.   
> Related documents: [Setting up and managing GitHub profiles | Github official documents](https://docs.github.com/zh/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile)

### Create a new repository

Create a new repository in your Github homepage. The repository name must be **your GitHub username**, for example, the following figure is `rento666`, and then add a `README.md` file. We just need to add the required information to this file.

As shown in the figure below, the option `Add a README file` is not checked. It is recommended to check it (checking it will save you the trouble of creating it manually). Click Create to complete the creation.

* rento666/rento666 is a ‚ú®special ‚ú® repository that you can use to add README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it is public and initialize it with README to get started.

### Edit README

Here is the interface for editing the README.md file:

![Initial content of the README file](https://s2.loli.net/2024/11/14/TSXN2cr86Oy3jeI.png)

### Started

The content that can be added to README can be your own introduction, open source projects, personal information, blogs, resumes, etc.

Markdown is highly extensible and supports HTML, Emoji, etc., so you can customize your own unique homepage~

However, human energy is limited, so we can fork the templates we think are good to our own warehouse, and then modify them to our own style.

#### My homepage

Because I like to watch the Battle of the Two Cities, I used pictures from the anime. The screenshot of the homepage is as follows (long screenshot, loading may be slow):

#### Modification
In my homepage, I used the following template, you can copy it to your own `README.md` file:

- The first step is to copy README:

- Step 2: After copying, press `CTRL+F` to replace the name, user name, hobbies, blog link and other information.

- Step 3. After modifying README.md, click Actions in the repository to create a workflow, as shown below:

![Click Actions to create a workflow](https://s2.loli.net/2024/11/15/WxnbTOy3mQkp175.png)

After entering, click `Configure` of `Simple workflow`, as shown below:

![Click Configure](https://s2.loli.net/2024/11/15/EmW2fhUDlIRr1wT.png)

Add the following code (need to be separated, don't put it in one file):

# run automatically every 2 hours

## Star trend chart

In the `README.md` file in the root directory of your own open source project, add the following code:
* Among them, `your own GitHub username` needs to be replaced with your own Github username, for example, the figure below is `rento666`.
* `Open source project warehouse name` needs to be replaced with your own open source project warehouse name, the figure below is `My-Blog-By-Hugo-stack`.
