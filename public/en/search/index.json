[{"content":"Introduction Every time I see a big guy\u0026rsquo;s Github homepage is very cool, I always envy him. Those big guys are really amazing. Not only are they technically strong, but even their Github personal homepages are cool.\nSo I looked up information and finally decided to beautify my Github homepage\n(although I am a rookie and have not written any good open source projects\u0026hellip;)\nBeautify your personal homepage GitHub supports custom homepages.\nRelated documents: Setting up and managing GitHub profiles | Github official documents\nCreate a new repository Create a new repository in your Github homepage. The repository name must be your GitHub username, for example, the following figure is rento666, and then add a README.md file. We just need to add the required information to this file.\nAs shown in the figure below, the option Add a README file is not checked. It is recommended to check it (checking it will save you the trouble of creating it manually). Click Create to complete the creation.\nrento666/rento666 is a ‚ú®special ‚ú® repository that you can use to add README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it is public and initialize it with README to get started. Information when creating a repository\rEdit README Here is the interface for editing the README.md file:\nInitial content of the README file\rStarted The content that can be added to README can be your own introduction, open source projects, personal information, blogs, resumes, etc.\nMarkdown is highly extensible and supports HTML, Emoji, etc., so you can customize your own unique homepage~\nHowever, human energy is limited, so we can fork the templates we think are good to our own warehouse, and then modify them to our own style.\nShare an excellent collection: awesome-github-profile-readme | Github\nawesome-github-profiles | Github\nbeautify-github-profile | Github\nawesome github profile readme chinese | Github\nawesome-github-profile-readme-templates | Github\nMy homepage Because I like to watch the Battle of the Two Cities, I used pictures from the anime.
