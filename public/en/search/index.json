After searching for a long time, I found that this Hugo | (Github)\u0026rsquo;s Stack theme | (Github) is quite in line with my aesthetics, so I decided to use Hugo to write a blog.\nThere are a few points to note:\nThe version I use is Hugo-stack theme-magic modification version | (Github). Since this version (as of now) has not been updated for two years (the last update was in 2022), for the latest version of Hugo, executing hugo server may report an error. You need to copy the error cause yourself and ask AI (such as ChatGPT, etc.) to solve the error. Usage (MarkDown syntax) Collapsible code block This is the title (Click to expand and collapse) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // Remove the \\ in front of % {{\\% spoiler %}} Content {{\\% /spoiler \u0026#34;This is the title\u0026#34; %}} // Remove the \\ in front of % Common sense (for me, I need to remember this) HTML character set - space Space: \u0026amp;nbsp; Press the space key to display it. The width is affected by the font. Space: \u0026amp;ensp; has a width of $\\frac{1}{2}$ Chinese characters, not affected by fonts. Space: \u0026amp;emsp; has a width of 1 Chinese character, not affected by fonts. Unresolved issues (updated at any time) The following issues are based on hugo v0.138.0 (maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to operate/doge). How to check hugo version?
