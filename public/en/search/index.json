After searching for a long time, I found that this Hugo | (Github)\u0026rsquo;s Stack theme | (Github) is quite in line with my aesthetics, so I decided to use Hugo to write a blog.\nThere are a few points to note:\nThe version I use is Hugo-stack theme-magic modification version | (Github). Since this version (as of now) has not been updated for two years (the last update was in 2022), for the latest version of Hugo, executing hugo server may report an error.
